Groovy Globals is a Swing app built using Groovy to exercise the Globals Java API. The goal was to see if Groovy as a dynamic, more declarative, and less verbose alternative to Java, could be used effectively to invoke the Globals API.

To run Groovy Globals, install Groovy from http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download and then go to the source directory where you have the Groovy Globals Main.groovy file.

Then simply run:
groovy Main

An Eclipse .project file is also provided which you can import into Eclipse. Then assuming you have the Groovy Eclipse plugin installed, you can select Main.Groovy and do Run As/Groovy Script.
