Functionality:
This project is called Tundra. Tundra allows user to create prototypes of web applications fast without any line of server-side code. The service provides online storage based on Globals DB, user interface for database schema management and  JS framework which allows to operate with remote data transparently. Also it automatically generates example html forms based on schema for operating with data.

Implementation

Globals layer:
It writes data in raw JSON format. Maintains indexes. 
It supports filtering, sorting and pagination.

JavaScript Layer:
The one provides CRUD-and-Searching functionality based on ActiveRecord pattern. After schema creation user receives auto-generated javascript-file. This library allows him  to call CRUD-functions on javascript "classes" and objects. All functions are asynchronous and designed using the callbacks-model.

Data transferring between JS and server is implemented by Ajax-calls (using JSON protocol) and fully transparent for end-developers.

What is ready at the moment:

CRUD
Filtering
Ordering

Near future:
user sessions and authorization
associations (relationships)
validations
using indexing in filtering - needs selectivity storage
pagination on JavaScript layer
view-template engine
